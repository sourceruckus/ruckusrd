The RuckusRD squashfs rootfs mechanism is perfect for providing the illusion
of a read-write root filesystem when using read-only media (e.g.,
CD/DVD-ROM, write-protected flash).

I have not checked with any DOD security folk regarding this, but it
certainly seems to me to be a silver bullet for the ongoing IA problem of
downgrading machines classification after returning from a top secret
mission.  Reboot.  Unclassified.

Granted, non-memory-retentive rootfs means you'll lose data that might be
important (e.g., log files, state files) mid-mission if a machine crashes or
gets rebooted for some reason.  I'm pretty sure all these scenarios can be
worked around, though, perhaps resulting in one or two machines with real
storage and the rest of the machines running non-retentively (e.g., backbone
servers with real storage fetching all systems' log files in real-time).
Then you'd just have to wory about downgrading one or two backbone servers.
