* Some dependence on host system libs is OK

Ok, so we went through a big "no host utils" push, and now we do not include
any programs (binary or otherwise) from the host system in the resulting
initramfs.  We *do* still slurp up needed host system libraries though.  The
rationale is that, unlike programs/utils, libraries aren't going to break any
of our initramfs functionality (mostly scripts depending on specific behavior
and command line usage).

* But what if it's not?

Of course, I could always change my mind about that.  Seems like non-trivial
effort for next to no gain at the moment... but if I *do* run into a real
reason to do it, we would just add the required libs to =subprojects= and build
them.

I suppose the problem I could run into with host system libs would be if our
host system has old/outdated versions of libraries our utils need newer
versions of.  Shouldn't really happen though, unless you're trying to use this
on a discustingly old host system.  And even if your system is that whacked,
your entire compilation toolchain is gonna be suspect... so not my problem.

* What current libs do we depend on?

In our =subprojects= dir, we build =util-linux= so that we can provide our
maint shell with a *real* fdisk program (the busybox applet didn't support GPT
at the time, and might still not), as well as a more featureful blkid program.
This also provides =libuuid=, =libblkid=, =libfdisk=, and =libsmartcols=.

We also build =eudev=, which provides us with =libudev=.

The =e2fsprogs= build provides us with =libext2fs=, =libe2p=, =libss=, and
=libcom_err=.

Building =lvm2= provides us with =libdevmapper=.

Building =zstd= gives us =libzstd=.

The =zfs= build gives us =libnvpair=, =libuutil=, =libzfsbootenv=,
=libzfs_core=, =libzfs=, and =libzpool=.

Anything else we add to the initramfs that needs those libs should make sure to
compile and link against the copies we built, *not* libraries present on the
host system.

Other libs just get slurped up from the host system.  At present, that includes
the following:

ld-linux-x86-64
libacl
libaio
libattr
libcrypt
libc
libdl
libgcc_s
libgcrypt
libgpg-error
libkmod
liblzma
liblzo2
libm
libncursesw
libpthread
libgcc_s
libreadline
libresolv
librt
libsystemd
libtinfo
libutil
libz
libcrypto.so
libefiboot
libefivar
libpopt
libstdc++
libxxhash
liblz4

* Why did I add zstd to =subprojects=?

This is really the only library I've run into so far that was unavailable on
"old" systems I was still supporting at the time.  I think it may have been
Ubuntu 18.04?  Either way, I wanted to be able to support zstd compresion in
squashfs-utils (requiring libzstd) and command line compress/decompress using
zstd, so it got added to =subprojects=.  It's a prefect example of what type of
things *will* get added: special cases that we need to.
