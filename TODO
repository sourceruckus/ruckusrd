* For 1.0.0

 1. fix all the FIXMEs

 2. documentation (html, man)

 3. Maybe revamp command-line usage?

 4. Maybe add checksum verification of sqsh_layers to linuxrc?  If anything's
    been modified, make a lot of noise and don't boot.

 5. Add --with-system-{busybox,e2fsprogs,eudev,lvm2,mdadm,squashfs-tools}
    configure flags.

 6. Build something into the build system to fetch submodules when building
    from dist tarball.  Right now, you can really only build the subprojects
    via a git clone.


* For 0.13

 1. Rip out any remaining squashfs.img device mapper garbage.


* For 0.12.x

 1. Uh, oh...  I'm getting tons of "systemd-journald: Failed to open system
    journal: Operation not supported" messages in dmesg when using a ram_layer.
    They went away after I did a journalctl --verify... which passed just fine.
    Very odd.  Not sure I can fix this prior to systemd handoff...

 2. Clean up remaining systemd warts (e.g., rc.local, ruckusrd_umount service).

 3. Pretty sure I broke out-of-tree building at some point... need to fix that.

 4. Figure out how to purge upper/work w/out borking the overlayfs mount so we
    can implement a sqsh-commit routine that doesn't require a reboot.
