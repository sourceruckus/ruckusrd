* For 1.0.0

 - fix all the FIXMEs

 - documentation (html, man)

 - Maybe revamp command-line usage?

 - Maybe add checksum verification of sqsh_layers to linuxrc?  If anything's
   been modified, make a lot of noise and don't boot.

 - Add --with-system-{busybox,e2fsprogs,eudev,lvm2,mdadm,squashfs-tools}
   configure flags.

 - Build something into the build system to fetch submodules when building from
   dist tarball.  Right now, you can really only build the subprojects via a
   git clone.


* For 0.13

 - Rip out any remaining squashfs.img device mapper garbage.

 - Upgrade to latest busybox, maybe latest other subprojects.

 - Switch dist target to tar.xz.

 - Migrate to manually layering multiple lower layers so work around overlayfs
   xino wonky problems.


* Could happen in 0.12.x stable release

 - Clean up remaining systemd warts (e.g., rc.local, ruckusrd_umount service).

 - Pretty sure I broke out-of-tree building at some point... need to fix that.

 - Tidy up  linuxrc output.  "quiet"  mode should  be silent to  match expected
   behavior in  most distros.  Perhaps  prefix each  output w/ "ruckusrd:  " or
   something  like that  to differentiate  our initramfs  messages from  kernel
   spew?

 - Allow passing overlayfs mount options on kernel command line.  Right now,
   default mount opts are used, but people might want to play with overlayfs
   mount options (e.g., index, nfs).  The existing `rootflags` option is just
   for the initial /sysroot mount, prior to doing anything special.
