* For 1.0.0

 1. fix all the FIXMEs

 2. documentation (html, man)

 3. Maybe revamp command-line usage?

 4. Maybe add checksum verification of sqsh_layers to linuxrc?  If anything's
    been modified, make a lot of noise and don't boot.

 5. Add --with-system-{busybox,e2fsprogs,eudev,lvm2,mdadm,squashfs-tools}
    configure flags.

 6. Build something into the build system to fetch submodules when building
    from dist tarball.  Right now, you can really only build the subprojects
    via a git clone.


* For 0.13

 1. Rip out any remaining squashfs.img device mapper garbage.


* For 0.12.x

 1. Uh, oh...  I'm getting tons of "systemd-journald: Failed to open system
    journal: Operation not supported" messages in dmesg when using a ram_layer.
    They went away after I did a journalctl --verify... which passed just fine.
    Very odd.  Not sure I can fix this prior to systemd handoff...

 2. Clean up remaining systemd warts (e.g., rc.local, ruckusrd_umount service).

 3. Pretty sure I broke out-of-tree building at some point... need to fix that.

 4. Figure out if/how to purge upper/work w/out borking the overlayfs mount so
    we can implement a sqsh-commit routine that doesn't require a reboot.  This
    may not be possible w/out new features being added to overlayfs in the
    kernel.

 5. Tidy up linuxrc output.  "quiet" mode should be silent to match expected
    behavior in most distros.  Perhaps prefix each output w/ "ruckusrd: " or
    something like that to differentiate our initramfs messages from kernel
    spew?

 6. Fix non-retentive mode (ram_layer) to include the topmost upper retentive
    layer as the topmost lower ro layer.  That seems like an obvious oopsie in
    the original sqsh_layers implementation, as that's roughly how the old
    squashfs.img system worked.

 7. Allow passing overlayfs mount options on kernel command line.  Right now,
    default mount opts are used, but people might want to play with overlayfs
    mount options (e.g., index, nfs).  The existing `rootflags` option is just
    for the initial /sysroot mount, prior to doing anything special.
