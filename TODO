* For 1.0.0

 1. Iron out the kinks using new versions of udev and systemd (and update
    README)

 2. Use BusyBox instead of host system binaries for initramfs population

 3. Remove old squashfs.img support now that we have new OverlayFS-based
    sqsh_layers implemented.

 4. Maybe revamp command-line usage

 5. Add checksum verification of sqsh_layers to linuxrc.  If anything's been
    modified, make a lot of noise and don't boot.


* For whenever

 1. fix all the FIXMEs

 2. test with DM udev events turned on, document results

 3. documentation (html, man)
