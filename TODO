* For 1.0.0

 1. Maybe revamp command-line usage

 2. Add checksum verification of sqsh_layers to linuxrc.  If anything's been
    modified, make a lot of noise and don't boot.

 3. Straighten out mounting behavior on EFI systems where "boot" partition
    isn't mounted at /boot.  Right now, things get really confusing because
    /boot is a part of your layered rootfs... but the *contents* of /boot don't
    stay consistent with the actual boot device.

 4. Clean up remaining systemd warts (e.g., rc.local, ruckusrd_umount service).

 5. Add --with-system-{busybox,e2fsprogs,eudev,lvm2,mdadm,squashfs-tools}
    configure flags.

 6. Build something into the build system to fetch submodules when building
    from dist tarball.  Right now, you can really only build the subprojects
    via a git clone.

 7. Rip out any remaining squashfs.img device mapper garbage.


* For whenever

 1. fix all the FIXMEs

 2. documentation (html, man)
