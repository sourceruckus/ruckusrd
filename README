ruckusrd - a super awesome, yet simple, mkinitrd replacement

This script is a derivative of fedora's livecd-creator's mayflower script,
written by David Zeuthen <davidz@redhat.com>, circa Fedora 8.

It's been largely rewritten to be a mkinitrd replacement specifically for
embedded systems and removable media, but it's also perfectly usable on normal
desktop Linux systmes.

Due to it's primary use (embedded systems, removable media), it behaves a bit
differently than your run-of-the-mill mkinitrd.

 1. All kernel bits needed for booting are assumed to be built in to the kernel
    (e.g., scsi_mod, sg, sd_mod, libata, usb_storage, ext2, uhci_hcd, ehci_hcd,
    ohci_hcd, sr_mod, cdrom, dm_snapshot, dm_zero, dm_mirror, dm_region_hash,
    dm_log, dm_mod, raid1) except for DEVICE DRIVERS.  Drivers for individual
    SATA or PATA controllers need to get added to the initrd, but everything
    needed to boot from CD-ROM or USB flash drive should be compiled into the
    kernel.

 2. Instead of selecting only the needed modules to support mounting the rootfs
    of the host system running the script, ruckusrd sticks ALL the compiled ATA
    modules (and their dependencies) in the initialramfs.  This is an attempt
    to make the resulting initrd as system-independent as possible.

 3. If a squashfs.img exists at / of the rootfs, the initrd combines it with a
    writable overlay (RAM via losetup) via the device mapper (so that it can be
    mounted read/write).  The resulting virtual block device is then used as
    the root device for booting.  If 'to_ram' is added to the kernel command
    line, the initrd loads the squashfs image directly into RAM (so that the
    underlying block device can be safely removed).  If a squashfs.img doesn't
    exist, the system is booted in a normal manor.

 4. By default, the rootfs is mounted read-only.  It's normally up to the
    booting system's init scripts to remount read-write if desired.  However,
    this behavior can be changed by adding 'rw' to the kernel command line.

 5. If LVM is used for rootfs, it MUST be specified using the /dev/mapper/VG-LV
    notation.  Using root=/dev/VG-LV notation WILL NOT work.
