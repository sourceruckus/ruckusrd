RuckusRD - a super awesome, yet simple, mkinitrd replacement

This utility is a derivative of fedora's livecd-creator's mayflower script,
written by David Zeuthen <davidz@redhat.com>, circa Fedora 8.

It's been largely rewritten to be a mkinitrd replacement specifically for
embedded systems and removable media, but it's also perfectly usable on normal
desktop Linux systms.


Strengths:

 1.  Layered Squashfs Root Filesystem.  When supplied with one or more
     sqsh_layers containing a root filesystem, an initrd created by
     RuckusRD will create a read-write virtual device for the rootfs
     by combining the squashfs image(s) (read-only by nature) with a
     read-write upper layer.  If another block device is used for the
     upper layer, changes to the system will be persistent.  If the
     upper layer is RAM, the system becomes non-persistent (any
     changes will go away upon reboot).
     
     Furthermore, when using RAM for upper layer, the lower
     sqsh_layers can be loaded entirely into RAM, enabling the user to
     unmount and remove the boot media.

     You don't HAVE to use sqsh_layers, though.  You can use an initrd
     created by RuckusRD to boot a normal old root filesystem and
     still benefit from the other bits of awesomeness RuckusRD
     provides.

     See docs/sqsh_layers.txt for more info.

 2.  Universal Initramfs.  Images created by RuckusRD can be used for
     multiple machines with different hardware without regenerating
     initrd.  All the kernel modules needed for early boot (e.g.,
     sccsi, filesystems), maintenance shells (e.g., USB HID,
     keyboard), and networking (e.g., wired/wireless subsystems,
     protocols, device drivers) are included in the initramfs, along
     with any modules they in turn require.

     Actually, as of v0.15, ALL kernel modules are included in the
     initramfs so that everything the kernel was configured to be able
     to do is fully availabile in the maintenence shell.

 3.  Swiss army knife maintenance shell of doom.  The maintenence
     shell provided is a fully functional embedded rootfs with
     BusyBox, eudev, lvm, mdadm, e2fsprogs, squashfs-tools, the
     OpenZFS userland tools, syslinux, efibootmgr, wired networking
     utilities, rsync, and ssh.

See docs/ for more ramblings.  ;-)

Also included are a bunch of scripts to help make kernel
compilation/installation as painless as possible.

kernel-builder - Compiles the kernel, creates an initrd using
ruckusrd, and packages it up into a self-extracting archive capable of
installing itself on a list of machines.

extractenator - Create your own self extracting archives with embedded
installation script (used by kernel-builder).

firmwarenator - Create a fw.img containing all the firmware needed for
a particular host's hardware.

doit - Execute a command in the background and email the output
somewhere when done.
