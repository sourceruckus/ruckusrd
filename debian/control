Description: RuckusRD - a super awesome, yet simple, mkinitrd replacement
 RuckusRD provides you with an initramfs capable of 1) creating a
 Layered Squashfs Root Filesystem (great for baselining!), 2) being
 used on all different kinds of hardware (instead of needing to
 re-build your initramfs for each system), and 3) giving you a super
 handy maintentence shell for maintaining your sqsh_layers or fixing
 boot issues.
